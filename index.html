                    Hi! I am Ishaan Punetha , 19 year old Computer and Webdev enthusiast currently learning about tech and engineering . Doing my B. Tech in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from Bennett University , Greater Noida , Uttar Pradesh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now as I type this paragraph I am pretty much done with the fundamentals of HTML and guess what ? I am the one who is writing down the code for this HTML webpage covering all the fundamental knowledge I have amassed of this language over the past couple of days!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had been been through some really low phases of my life and trying to rebuild my life from scratch trying to become more powerful and a really knowledgable individual trying to be as best a possible . Currently for my web dev journey I  have plans for picking up Javascript and learnt it from scratch and tryna build some cool webstuff with it.
                </p>

                        <p>Well coding is deinetly one of my hobbies that I really cherish . I guess the idea of building things from scratch really makes me feel driven towards making a groundbreaking innovation. Although I have not really made anything advanced so far but yeah once the fundamentals are clear and you know the basic conceptas things become way too smoother and it becomes an addictive cycle where you are working and working on making something cooler evertime! üòÄ</p>

                        <p>I am mostly rock genre , I personally like the famous American Band of Breaking Benjamin , their album Phobia is one  of my favourites . I really like the deepness that lies underneath each and every song of theirs . It definetly is somehthing anyone struggling with internal demons and addictions would find comforting to listen to!</p>

I got chance to play GTA 4 in my first year of College Life and I really loved it . The storyline is pretty intrguing as well as the character of Niko Bellic is pretty mesmerizing as well.
